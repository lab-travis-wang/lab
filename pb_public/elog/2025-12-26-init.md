# Log System Initialization

**Date:** 2025-12-26
**Status:** In Progress

## Summary
We are initializing the experiment log system to better track the progress of our AI-native lab experiments.

## Decisions
- Use **Markdown** for log content to keep it portable and readable.
- Store logs in `pb_public/elog` to avoid database complexity for simple static content.
- Use a `manifest.json` to index files for the frontend to fetch.

## Next Steps
- Implement the frontend viewer in `pb_public/elog/index.html`.
- Add a navigation link from the main homepage.

## Rendering Fixture

This section is used to verify markdown rendering:

1. Ordered list item
2. Another item with `inline code`

- Unordered list
- **Bold text** and *italic text*

### Code Block

```bash
echo "hello"
```

### Table

| Col A | Col B |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 |

### Link
